# Unsupported Features

## Blockquotes

Typst 'Ilm support a totally different style for blockquotes. This feature is not supported in Quarto now.

Test blockquote:

> This is a blockquote.

We just suggest you to use the default Quarto blockquote style, or callout blocks for special notes.

::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are five types of callouts, including:
`note`, `warning`, `important`, `tip`, and `caution`.
